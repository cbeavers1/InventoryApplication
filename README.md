# InventoryApplication

This application was designed with the intent for users to have the ability to track arbitrary items with the most arbitrary of values. It was designed for a user that may work in a warehouse or retail store to keep track of stock.

The application presents 4 total screens: a login, a list of items, an item adding screen, and a details screen. These screens span the interface required for users to achieve their goals. 

To design this app, a lot of planning was done. Initially, I was against planning with fear of change, however, it became clear early on that not planning is irresponsible. Thorough planning can help to achieve the most efficient application development by saving vast amounts of time.  

I was sloppy with the testing for this application given the allotted time. Had the time been available, I would have run JUnit tests to ensure functionality of the program. I did, however, have the oppurtunity to test the user interface by allowing family to try the app. I recieved feedback from 3 different users before I attained my final design. Most of the testing for this app was done through manual bounds checking. I would simply test the input by entering values believed to be bounds beyond what are required for the application to function correctly.

Ultimately, determination is what brought this application to a fully functional state.
